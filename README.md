### Project Description

Our analysis will collect stock, crypto and real estate data via APIs to create individual stock, crypto and real estate portfolios. The selected data will be cleaned prior to analysis before presenting our visualization and conclusion. Our visual representations  will be displayed through an interactive dashboard to allow end-user review of our analysis.

### Research Questions

* Can investors rationalise continued investment in FB stock following the companies $230bn wipeout and biggest one day loss in history for a US company? 
* What is most desirable to Australian real estate investors? 
* Is cryptocurrency a desirable investment in comparrison to its risk?
* Quantitative analysis of each individual asset class?

### Real Estate

ES - Using a Domain's API to fetch the latest auction data such such as:
   - "numberListedForAuction"
   - "numberWithdrawn"
   - "numberUnreported"
   - "numberAuctioned"
   - "numberSold"
   - "totalSales"
   - "median"
   - "adjClearanceRate"
     
## Findings 

  Through our quantitative analysis of the asset classes we worked with (crypto, stocks, property), we were able to efficiently visualise our results and           determine key indicators to compare between them. Through the dashboard we created, we were able to display this analysis to assist in the users decision on     what investment avenue they wanted to take, factoring in their risk tolerence. 

  ### Crypto Analysis
  Within the crypto analysis I was able to narrowed it down to four main indicators to evaluate the asset class including; daily returns, cumulative returns,       correlation between different cryptocurrencies, and finally the sharpe ratio.  
  
  ### Daily Returns
  In this analysis, daily returns indicated the profit or loss in determined by the changing closing prices over a period of time. I found that crypto as a whole   is quite volitile and this volitility is excellently displayed through the range of fluctuation within the daily returns as seen in the chart below.

  Through the differences in how long each crypto currency has been trading, daily returns were far easier to visualise on a smaller time frame that allows the     same duration of data to be displayed collectively as seen below.

  ### Cumulative Returns 
  Cumulative retuns gives us a beter view of the profitability of an asset over time, enabaling us to determine its performance as seen below. This data
  effectively shows the volitility of the market and the huge returns that can come with it.

  Again, lets take a closer look into how this is data looks on a shorter time frame.

  ### Sharpe Ratio
  The Sharpe ratio in this analysis measures the performance of a crypto in comparison to a risk adjusted average return of that crypto currency. Due to crypto     being an overall volitile market, this representation must be viewed with the understanding that its comparing to the mean of crypto assets. Generally           speaking the higher the sharpe ration the better, using 1.0 as a desired target for good returns from its presented risk and anything un the upside presents     further oportunity.

  ### Correlation 
  The below correlation heat map displays a Pearson correlation between the selected crypto currencies. The pearson heat map shows a linear comparison between     two assets at a time, with 1 being exactly correlated and -1 being the opposite. From my analysis we can conclude that the crypto market is highly correlated     as a whole which is something to take into concideration when trying to hedge your investments.
