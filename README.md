### Project Description

Our analysis will collect stock, crypto and real estate data via APIs to create individual stock, crypto and real estate portfolios. The selected data will be cleaned prior to analysis before presenting our visualization and conclusion. Our visual representations  will be displayed through an interactive dashboard to allow end-user review of our analysis.

### Research Questions

* Can investors rationalise continued investment in FB stock following the companies $230bn wipeout and biggest one day loss in history for a US company? 
* What is most desirable to Australian real estate investors? 
* Is cryptocurrency a desirable investment in comparrison to its risk?
* Quantitative analysis of each individual asset class?

### Real Estate

ES - Using a Domain's API to fetch the latest auction data such such as:
   - "numberListedForAuction"
   - "numberWithdrawn"
   - "numberUnreported"
   - "numberAuctioned"
   - "numberSold"
   - "totalSales"
   - "median"
   - "adjClearanceRate"
     
###Findings 

Through our quantitative analysis of the asset classes we worked with(crypto, stocks, property), we were able to efficiently visualise our results and determine key indicators to compare between them. Through the dashboard we created, we were able to display this analysis to assist in the users decision on what investment avenue they wanted to take, factoring in their risk tolerence.
